Basic usage
===========

First you need to create a directory for your documentation (preferably within your code repository - for your own sake).

Then you add a plaintext file called **index.md** in that directory.

index.md
--------
The index file is the file that LocalDocs shows you if the path entered points to a directory rather than a file. Just to be clear; 
the index file of the directory at the end of the path is shown.

Sub-directories
---------------
You can create all the sub-directories you want.

The URL for each file in your documentation follows the following format
```
http://localdocs.local/some/path/within/your/docs/filename
```
where *filename* is the name of the file without the ".md" extension.
